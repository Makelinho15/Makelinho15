- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Makelinho15 im a coding student at Mali Programer
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in game coding,and app development
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML,CSS but soon I will start with JS
- Coding isn't just typing in random letters and numbers it's a way of life it is a job and it's a way of learning. Even if you get frustrated you should never give up.Even if you get fired don't give up. Start your own journey,learn something new.
